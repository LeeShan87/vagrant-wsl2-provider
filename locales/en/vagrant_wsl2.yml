        CRITICAL ERROR: Dirty WSL distribution detected!

        The distribution '%{name}' already exists on your system and may contain modifications
        that would contaminate your Vagrant environment.

        To fix this, either:
        1. Remove the existing distribution: wsl --unregister %{name}
        2. Or manually create a clean base in cache directory: %{cache_path}

        Clean base distribution name: %{clean_name}

        This provider requires clean, reproducible environments and cannot proceed with
        potentially contaminated distributions.
